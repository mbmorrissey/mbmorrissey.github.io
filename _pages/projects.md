Here are a few ongoing projects and general areas of research interest:

## Soay sheep

[Soay sheep project](https://soaysheep.bio.ed.ac.uk/)

## ELA lake trout

[IISD Experimental Lakes Area](https://www.iisd.org/ela/)

## Measurement of natural selection

If I have a coherent research theme, it is methods for quantifying natural selection.  Here are a few key outputs from this area (see also publications):

- how to calculate selection gradients from arbitrary functions
- how to conceptualise selection when traits affect one another
- special considerations in meta-analysis for inferring things like variability in selection and and the prevelance of sexually-antagonistic selection
- calculation of selection gradients from exponential functions (like log-link GLMs)
- dealing with environmental confounders

## Data logging
