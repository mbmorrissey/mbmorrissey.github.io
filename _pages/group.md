Possibly the only person ever to come to St Andrews to shift away from studying seals!  Rebecca is a research fellow funded by the DFG.

Rebecca is working on various problems, including: selection analysis in the presence of confounding environmental variables, development of low-cost low-power data loging platforms, and dealing with broken assumptions in common statistical models.

## Vivienne Litzke

Vivienne's PhD work so far around the consequences of space use, and how vegetation in the home range may mediate trade-offs between mothers and offspring.  Vivienne is also piloting accelerometry data logging in the Soay sheep.
