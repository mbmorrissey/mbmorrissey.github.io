## Quantitative skills

- BL1102: introducing all our first-years to data handling and visualisation in R via two weeks of practicals.  This works surprisignly well, in large part because of the School's commitment of a lot of demonstrator support to first year practicals.
- BL3320: Generalised models sessions to all Biology third year students
- BL5115: Introductory R and other parts of the quantiative skills delivered to all of our taught MSc students.


## Evolution

- BL3307: genetic basis of variation and evolution of continuous traits; </li>

We've had our first student article [published](https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/full/10.1111/jeb.14112) - Congratulations Finn.</li>
