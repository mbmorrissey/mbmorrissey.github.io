Here are the main modules to which I contribute, and a summary of the materials I deliver:

## Quantitative skills

- BL1102: introducing all our first-years to data handling and visualisation in R via two weeks of practicals.  
- BL3320: Generalised models sessions to all Biology third year students
- BL5115: Introductory R and other parts of the quantiative skills delivered to all of our taught MSc students.


## Evolution

- BL3307: genetic basis of variation and evolution of continuous traits
- BL4288 "Major Review Paper in Evoltuionary Biology" (Module Organiser): Basically a big exercise in writing feedback.  With support from class sessions and 1:1 meetings with staff, students prepare a review article including submission of an initial draft, responding to peer reviews, and re-submitting a final submission.  We've had our first student article [published](https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/full/10.1111/jeb.14112) - Congratulations Finn!


## Ecology

- New module for 2023/24 in Quantitative Ecology (Module Organiser): students tackle a range of topics in ecology through quantitative 'work packages' engaging deeply with classical theory and empirical analyses of contemporary data.
- BL5103: structured population models

## External teaching

- Training sessions for the IAPETUSII DTP in foundational statistics and meta-analysis
- Occasional international courses in statistical genetics (e.g., [this](https://www3.stat.sinica.edu.tw/sisg2015/index.html) and [this](https://jvanderw.une.edu.au/aabc_materials2020.htm))

## Books

### Using R
<img src="/images/Using_R_cover_small_file.jpg" align="left" width="170px"/>
Most modern statistics books for biologists aim to teach students to use R and become competent at data analysis in 180 or so pages.  In my experience, this leaves students able to run through examples, but puts them in a very frustrating situation when they try to move on to their own analyses.  Basically, it is very hard to simultaneously propel students along both their R learning curves and their statistical modelling learning curves (they are not the same thing!!).  This book supports instructors and students who would like to invest some time getting to know R first, focusing on mathematical operations, data handling and plotting.  Once we get a little way along our R learning curve, it can become a tool for learning about statistics.

### Elementary Statistical Modelling

How to map biological questions onto linear modeling formulations.  Assuming a bit of comfort in R, we take questions of relationships between two variables, differences in means among groups, effects of multiple variables, and interactions among variables one chapter at a time.  For its 180 or so pages, it doesn't go as far as most biostats books, but hopefully it sets students up to handle the basics well.  Particular attention is paid to avoiding common interpretive pitfalls and dispelling myths.  Everything is put in a unified linear modelling framework, with a chapter toward the end to ensure that students are literate in how their skills at developing linear models relates to classical tests (t-test, ANOVA, ANCOVA...).


### Example data files and book availability

The main data files for all examples in "Using R" and "Elementary Statistical Modelling" are [unicorns.csv](/files/unicorns.csv) and [unicornIslandDensity.csv](/files/unicornIslandDensity.csv).

Instructors interested in the teaching philosophy in "Using R" and "Elementary Statistical Modelling" should [contact me](https://mbmorrissey.github.io/contact/) for copies.  If you would like to use the books in your teaching, I can have batches printed for modest cost for you to distribute to your students.
