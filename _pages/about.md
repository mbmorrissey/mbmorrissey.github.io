I am a general quantitative biologist interested mostly in evolution, fish and wildlife management, statistics and electronics geekery.

My research group is based at the University of St Andrews where my day job is supposedly studying the generation-to-generation mechanics of natural selection and adaptive evolution in natural populations.  Research distractions from this are general statistics, fisheries and wildlife biology, and electronics.  

I teach various parts of our curriculum in general quantiative skills, statistical modelling, evolution and ecology, from first year through to MSc and PhD levels.  Parts of the quantiative skills teaching here are supported by my [books](/pages/projects) on learning to use R, and elementary linear modelling.

I am Deputy Director of the [Centre for Biological Diversity](https://biology.st-andrews.ac.uk/biodiversity/) in the [School of Biology](https://www.st-andrews.ac.uk/biology/) and the Director of Postgraduate (Research) Recruitment (it's not glamorous, almost everyone is director of something around here).
