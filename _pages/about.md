I am a general quantitative biologist interested mostly in evolution, fish and wildlife management, statistics and electronics geekery.

My research group is based at the University of St Andrews where my day job is supposedly studying the generation-to-generation mechanics of natural selection and adaptive evolution in natural populations.  Research distractions from this are general statistics, fisheries and wildlife biology, and electronics.  

I teach various parts of our curriculum in general quantiative skills, statistical modelling, evolution and ecology, from first year through to MSc and PhD levels.  Parts of the quantiative skills teaching here are supported by my books on learning to use R, and elementary linear modelling.

I am Deputy Director of the [Centre for Biological Diversity](https://biology.st-andrews.ac.uk/biodiversity/) in the [School of Biology](https://www.st-andrews.ac.uk/biology/) and the Director of Postgraduate (Research) Recruitment (it's not glamorous, almost everyone is director of something around here).


How to edit your site's GitHub repository
------
Many people use a git client to create files on their local computer and then push them to GitHub's servers. If you are not familiar with git, you can directly edit these configuration and markdown files directly in the github.com interface. Navigate to a file (like [this one](https://github.com/academicpages/academicpages.github.io/blob/master/_talks/2012-03-01-talk-1.md) and click the pencil icon in the top right of the content preview (to the right of the "Raw | Blame | History" buttons). You can delete a file by clicking the trashcan icon to the right of the pencil icon. You can also create new files or upload files by navigating to a directory and clicking the "Create new file" or "Upload files" buttons.
