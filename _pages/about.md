I am a general quantitative biologist interested mostly in evolution, fish and wildlife management, statistics and electronics geekery.

My research group is based at the University of St Andrews where my main focus is studying the generation-to-generation mechanics of natural selection and adaptive evolution in natural populations.  Research adjuncts this are general statistics, fisheries and wildlife biology, and electronics.  

I teach various parts of our curriculum in general quantitative skills, statistical modelling, evolution and ecology, from first year through to MSc and PhD levels.  Parts of the quantitative skills teaching here are supported by my [books](/teaching) on learning to use R, and elementary linear modelling.

I am Director of the [Centre for Biological Diversity](https://biology.st-andrews.ac.uk/biodiversity/) in the [School of Biology](https://www.st-andrews.ac.uk/biology/) CBD matters may be directed [here](mailto:cbd.director@st-andrews.ac.uk) or via my regular [contact](https://mbmorrissey.github.io/contact/).

Prospective students and other researchers are welcome to [contact me](https://mbmorrissey.github.io/contact/) to discuss projects.
